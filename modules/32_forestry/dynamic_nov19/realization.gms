*' @description dynamic_nov19 realization builds up of the affore_vegc_dec16 realization
*' and additionally handles the production of two timber products from plantation
*' forests while still accounting for afforestation policies. This realization
*' harvests timber from available plantations to meet a portion of overall timber
*' demand. The model is free to decide the amount of production coming from plantations.
*' New plantations are also established in the simulation step to account for future
*' timber demand and trade.
